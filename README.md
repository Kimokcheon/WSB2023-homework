# WSB2023-homework
My hands-on session for WSB2023
You can find a brief introduction to this project on [Bilibili](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1NR4y1a76A/)
## Introduction
In this hands-on session, we use Open-cv to implement face detection and recognition, face with mask detection, facial expression recognition and breathing mask recognition. In facial expression recognition, the facial expression of the currently detected face is displayed only when the face is not blocked. We have also added a breathing mask recognition function to the system so that when we detect that if users are not wearing breathing masks, the system will automatically announce to remind users to put it on.
